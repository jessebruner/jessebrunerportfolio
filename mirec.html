							<h1>Michigan Recreation</h1>
							<p>The Michigan Department of Natural Resources is responsible for managing and maintaining all of the state parks, forests, trails, beaches, and other state-owned property. As a service to residents, the department offers a "Recreation Search" tool which allows users to search for hiking trails, campgrounds, state parks, hunting areas, etc.</p>
							<p>As an avid hiker, I use this tool quite a bit to find trails and campgrounds for backpacking. I am consistently frustrated by how difficult it can be to find information with it &mdash; my experiences teetering on the edge of unhelpful and completely useless. Often times, I find it easier to use other online sources to find information I need.</p>
						<p>Thus, I decided to try my hand at improving the DNR (Department of Natural Resources) recreation search tool. How can this be easier to use? How can it provide better information? To answer those questions, I began a personal passion project: to fix the worst part of camping/hiking in Michigan.</p>
						<img src="images/mirec/searchpagecurrent.jpg" alt="old site picture" class="img-responsive" style="border:solid 1px grey;">
						<p><i>Previous site search page</i></p>
<br>
						<h2>1.0 Research</h2>
						<h3>1.1 Identifying Scope</h3>
						<p>The <a href="https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/parksandtrails/Default.aspx">recreation search tool</a> is a large website with thousands of pages. The scope of the project was narrowed to redesigning the primary pages and user flow for a hiker looking for a trail.</p>
						<br>
						<h3>1.2 Problems</h3>
						<p>After conducting a heuristic evaluation and an expert review, there were several issues identified which were detrimental to the user experience of the application.</p>

						<h4>Inconsistent with Michigan design guidelines</h4>
						<img src="images/mirec/compare1.jpg" alt="Michigan.gov homepage vs. Recreation tool homepage" class="img-responsive" style="border:solid 1px grey;">
						<p><i>Recreation tool homepage vs. Michigan.gov homepage </i></p>
						<p>A common path for discovering the Recreation Search Tool is through the Michigan.gov website. The issue lies in the seemingly random change in design systems between the two websites. The Recreation Search Tool completely breaks any resemblance to the Michigan.gov website, while also breaking <a href="https://digitalguidelines.michigan.gov/">State of Michigan design guidelines for the web.</a> The redesigned tool must adhere to the guidelines set forth for digital applications to improve user experience, learnability, and usability, as well as align with the Michigan brand.</p>

						<h4>Uninformative search results</h4>
						<img src="images/mirec/compare2.jpg" alt="Trail search results" class="img-responsive" style="border:solid 1px grey;">
						<p><i>Trail search results on current website</i></p>
						<p>When the user is looking for a trail to hike on or a place to camp, there are typically parameters. If a user wants to do a two day backpacking trip over the weekend, this user probably doesn't want to drive 9 hours to get to the park. This user also is not going to be looking for trails 50+ miles long, nor trails 8 miles long. This important information is not displayed when the user is scanning the trail search results, which means they would have to click on each trail which looks interesting. </p>

						<h4>Confusing reservation system</h4>
						<img src="images/mirec/compare3.jpg" alt="Campground page, to reservation page, to reservation selection." class="img-responsive" style="border:solid 1px grey;">
						<p><i>When you click on "Make a Reservation" you are taken to a seperate website. The campground you selected did not auto-fill on the new website.</i></p>
						<p>Most recreational activities require a reservation, however the reservation system in-place adds unnecessary burden on the user. When a user finds a campground they would like to go to and clicks "Make a Reservation", they will be taken to a completely seperate website. What's worse is that the field "state park" doesn't autofill when the user arrives. This means the user now has to think actively about what park and campground they wanted, as well as add additional actions the user must take to complete a task they already completed.  </p>

						<h3>1.3 Goals</h3>
						<p>
						<ol>
						<li><b>Overhaul UI.</b> Redesign application for usability and adhere to Michigan UI guidelines.</li>
						<li><b>Provide information when it's needed.</b> On all pages, information should be helpful and easy to find.</li>
						<li><b>Reduce user actions.</b> Tasks should be able to be performed with as few clicks as possible. </li>
						<li><b>Changes should be feasible.</b> Although this is a passion project, all changes to the tool should not require drastic alterations to underlying infrastructure. </li>
					</ol>
					<br>
					<h2>2.0 Design</h2>
					<h3>2.1 Ideation</h3>
						<p>Before I began designing, I created a user flow diagram detailing all the actions a user might take while searching for campground and things to do while camping. I then identified key points in the flow that could be simplified.

						From there, low-fidelity paper sketches were created to guide the rest of the design process. The paper prototypes brought several revisions of content structure, and specifically encouraged consideration for the end-to-end user experience. In this, determinations were made about cross-page navigation in different user contexts and paths. </p>
						<img src="images/mirec/paper.jpg" alt="Paper prototype" class="img-responsive" style="border:solid 1px grey;">
						<p><i>Some paper prototype screens</i></p>
					  <h3>2.2 Wireframes</h3>
						<p>The next step was wireframing. We were going onto week two of the project, and this was where most of the design decisions were made. This also led to a variety of problem solving: how can we easily help users find where to go? How can we simplify searching? How can we organize content on each page? Most of all, how can all of this be done while meeting the goals of the project and being technically feasible? </p>

						<h4>Searching</h4>
						<img src="images/mirec/wireframe1.jpg" alt="Trail search page" class="img-responsive" style="border:solid 1px grey;">
						<p><i>Trail search results on wireframe</i></p>
						<p>To make scanning easier, additional information was included on each search result. Now, if the data is available, the name, brief description, activity list, distance, region, trail type, and available campsites would be listed. This is compared to before, when only the brief descriptin and activity list was included. </p>

						<h4>Trail Pages</h4>
						<img src="images/mirec/wireframe2.jpg" alt="Trail page" class="img-responsive" style="border:solid 1px grey;">
						<p><i>Trail details page</i></p>
						<p>The new content page considers hierarchy in a more pronounced way. Important information is with the rest of the content, and is larger than the rest of the text for easy scannability. Other information is included on the page, like on-trail campgrounds and connecting trails. This information is not included on the current page, but would assist hikers in planning for trips. Additionally, instead of hiding information behind other tabs, the trail map and directions map would be at the bottom of the page. This way, information needed when browsing is at the top and the information needed when making detailed plans is available near the bottom. This is true across wireframes.</p>

						<h4>Reservation Page</h4>
						<img src="images/mirec/wireframe3.jpg" alt="Reservation page" class="img-responsive" style="border:solid 1px grey;">
						<p><i>The new reservation page</i></p>
						<p>This page does not currently exist in the tool. On the original Recreation Search Tool, the user must exit and go to a different website to make reservations. After the redesign, all of that information is collected on a form in the Recreation Search Tool reservation page, sends that information to the reservation website, and then populates the page with an iFrame of the reservation website result. This is a band-aid solution to the cross-website mess, but is a cheap solution. Ideally, this would all happen natively in the Recreation Search Tool.</p>

						<h4>Trip Planner Tool</h4>
						<img src="images/mirec/wireframe4.jpg" alt="The Trip planner tool" class="img-responsive" style="border:solid 1px grey;">
						<p><i>The new trip planner page</i></p>
						<p>This page is also a new addition and is essentially a cleaner filter page. The user selects what they want to do (backpack, camp, fish, etc.), where in Michigan they want to travel to, other information which is specific to what they are doing (such as trail length), and trip length. The tool will spit out a filtered list of all trails, parks, campgrounds, hunting areas, marinas, etc. which meet the criteria. This is a conversational approach to filtering, and minimizes cognitive load for the user.</p>
						<br>
						<img src="images/mirec/wireframe5.jpg" alt="All wireframes" class="img-responsive" style="border:solid 1px grey;">
						<p><i>All wireframes</i></p>

					  <h3>2.3 Prototypes</h3>
						<p>After a user test with a hiker, a few revisions were made to the wireframes. In the final week of the project, hi-fidelity prototype screens were crafted. During the process of converting the wireframes into hi-fidelity screens, decisions about visual elements such as colors, drop shadows, button designs, and icons were made. Limited interactions were also implemented.</p>

						<h4>Final Search Page</h4>
						<img src="images/mirec/prototype1.jpg" alt="Final Search Page" class="img-responsive" style="border:solid 1px grey;">
						<p><i>Hi-fidelity screen of the search page</i></p>
						<p>A change implemented after user feedback was changing the information which is displayed to "completion time" from "on-trail campgrounds." This change provides more useful information to many hikers. Time commitment is a driving factor behind day trips and is far more important to have easily accessible than if there are campgrounds along the trail.</p>

						<h4>Final Trail/Park Page</h4>
						<img src="images/mirec/prototype2.jpg" alt="Ludington State Park page" class="img-responsive" style="border:solid 1px grey;">
						<p><i>A hi-fidelity state park screen; similar to trail pages, campground pages, etc. </i></p>
						<p>The final screens improve upon the current state park pages in three ways:

							<ol>
							<li><b>Easier to scan.</b> Important information is near the top and is larger. Detailed information is found at the bottom. More whitespace is introduced compared to before.</li>
							<li><b>Visually pleasing.</b> Previous pages felt slightly chaotic, had little prominance, and lacked an engaging design. The redesign delegates images to become hero-images, removes tabs, adds color, and puts content into a two-column grid layout.</li>
							<li><b>On-page reservations.</b> Now users do not have to leave the page to make reservations, simplifying the process of making a reservation by eliminating the need to go to a different page. </li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<img src="images/mirec/prototypecompare.jpg" alt="Comparison of two pages" class="img-responsive" style="border:solid 1px grey;">
					<p><i>On-page reservation system example  </i></p>

						<h4>Final Reservation Page</h4>
						<img src="images/mirec/prototype3.jpg" alt="Reservation page" class="img-responsive" style="border:solid 1px grey;">
						<p><i>The new reservation page</i></p>
						<p>Nearly unchanged from the wireframes, the new reservation page centralizes the entire process of making a reservation onto one page rather then spread across several websites.</p>

						<h4>Hi-Fidelity Trip Planner Tool</h4>
						<img src="images/mirec/prototype4.jpg" alt="Trip planner tool screens" class="img-responsive" style="border:solid 1px grey;">
						<p><i>The hi-fidelity trip planner screens</i></p>
						<p>A conversational approach to filtering, and minimizes cognitive load for the user. The page features detailed county-level regions which ease the search process. Once the form is submitted, a filtered list is returned of all activities and parks that meet the user criteria. </p>
						<br>
