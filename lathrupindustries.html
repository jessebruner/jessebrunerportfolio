							<h1>Lathrup Industries Website Redesign</h1>
							<p>The Lathrup Industries website serves as a tool for promoting the company, connecting with customers, providing examples of solutions and products, and being a reference and talking point while bidding on jobs with clients. The website serves as a critical tool all the way through the lengthy process of locking-in a sale, and thus was a priority project for me from the beginning of my time at Lathrup.</p>

							<p>During the summer of 2020, I lead the project to not only redesign and improve the website, but completely rethink Lathrup’s brand and customer journey. Changes to the website included the introduction of case studies, simplifying product pages and removing unnecessary content, implementing a consistent design system, and completely re-thinking the architecture, layout, structure, and design language of the site.</p>

<br>
							<h2>1.0 Research</h2>
							<h3>1.1 Identifying Scope</h3>
							<p>To properly redesign the website, I first needed to understand the business needs and requirements. To do this, I met with key stakeholders in the company (sales and management) to discuss their job role and how they use the website. This allowed me to paint a better picture of how the company operates and how Lathrup wins a bid for a project.</p>
							<p>From the meetings, there were two business needs for the website:
								<ol>
									<li>Convert visitors into information-seeking leads.</li>
									<li>Provide useful information about previous jobs to show customers solutions Lathrup has experience in.</li>
								</ol>
							</p>

							<h3>1.2 Interviews</h3>
							<p>After identifying scope, I performed a literature review on B2B website design, which I followed up by conducting interviews with two customers who used the site. These interviews were brief (5 – 10 minutes) as I was asking customers who were visiting Lathrup for other reasons to take time to talk with me. Notes were taken and then converted into insights, which in conjunction with the interviews I had with company stakeholders, helped identify three distinct core problems with the site. </p>


							<h3>1.3 Problems</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>The site was difficult to use and navigate.</b> Unnecessary interactions, a seemingly endless number of confusingly similar product pages, a vast number of accessibility issues, terrible responsive navigation, etc. In all, the site had collected over ten years of UX debt.</li>
									<li><b>It did not meet the needs of any stakeholder.</b> The site was inherently unhelpful to returning customers, was even less helpful for potential customers to learn about Lathrup, and was a failure to Lathrup management as a marketing tool.</li>
									<li><b>It had an inconsistent design system and was brand incoherent.</b></li>
								</ul>
<br>
								<h3>1.4 Customer Journey & Personas</h3>
								<p>To guide the design forward, personas were crafted based upon the initial interviews, website analytics, and other forms of data available to me. Customer journey maps were then created to visualize the path each persona might take. <br><i>Note: Customer journey maps were identified as a confidential artifact and thus have been omitted from this case study.</i></p>

							<br>
							<h3>1.5 Goals</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Improve usability and accessibility of the site. </b> The usability issues were identified in the navigation, poor page hierarchy and design, distracting videos, inconsistent design elements, a response site which was nearly unusable, and an absence of any basic accessibility features (such as alt tags).</li>
									<li><b>Simplify the site architecture.</b> The old Lathrup website had 70+ pages on it. This was not a large site, but the majority of those pages were "variations" of the old pages. This was a bloated and inefficient way of showcasing what Lathrup can do. </li>
									<li><b>Unify the site under one consistent design system and style.</b> By creating a simple design system and following a brand guide, the website could be easier to use, more beautiful, and brand-strengthening rather than brand-degrading.</li>
								</ul>
